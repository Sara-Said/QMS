It's my first laravel project 
I  really enjoyed to start this  good framework and I wished to complete the whole project but i can't catch the time because my work.  

I created only four controllers 

1- HomeController : for login and log out.
2-  AdminController : for adding,editing ,listing and deleting quizes.
3-  QuestionsController : for adding,editing ,listing and deleting questions.
4-  QuezQuestionsController : to  assign/adding questions for quizes ,editing ,listing and deleting questions.
